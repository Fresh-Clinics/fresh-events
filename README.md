# Fresh Clinics Member Events

For this project, we are using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs) and the [Luma API](https://docs.lu.ma).

[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/Fresh-Clinics/fresh-events) [Live Demo](https://fresh-events.vercel.app/)


## Configuration

Youâ€™ll need to use your own Luma API key and add it to a new file `.env.local`. You can use the `.env.local.template` as a starting point.
